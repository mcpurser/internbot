You will participate in all the same classroom activities as other students. However, you can choose not to take the anonymous TEALS program surveys. All students are given the option of not taking the surveys, and you will not be penalized in any way for not taking them. Your grades and school status will not be affected by the choice to not participate in the surveys.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>What types of questions are asked on the surveys?<\/b><br \/>\nIf you agree to participate, you will be asked to fill out two surveys about your attitudes about computer science, any previous exposure to computer science, intentions to study it further, and experiences as part of the TEALS program. No identifying information will be collected on the surveys.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Will your privacy be protected?<\/b><br \/>\nYes. All of your responses to the surveys will remain anonymous and cannot be linked to you in any way by the TEALS Program.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Are there any risks associated with participating in these program surveys?<\/b><br \/>\nWe do not believe there will be any risks to you associated specifically with these program surveys, beyond normal school activities.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Are there any benefits?<\/b><br \/>\nThere will be no direct benefits to you. However, the data collected will help to improve the TEALS program for students and teachers who participate in the future. More broadly, this data will inform the computer science education community about best practices in teaching computer science.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIf you have further questions about the TEALS program
