Instructions for making Internbot an executable

1. Ensure py2app is installed:
	pip install -U py2app

2. Ensure wx is installed (you gonna need it later, its a patch for a bug in py2app with Tkinter)
	pip install wxPython

3. Next set up the setup.py (Only do this if you don't have the setup.py from the previous version)
	py2applet --make-setup internbot.py 
	
	Should look like: 
	
	"""
	This is a setup.py script generated by py2applet

	Usage:
    	python setup.py py2app
	"""

	from setuptools import setup

	APP = ['internbot.py']
	DATA_FILES = ['Y2Logo.gif', 'topline_template.docx']
	OPTIONS = {}

	setup(
    	app=APP,
    	data_files=DATA_FILES,
    	options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    	setup_requires=['py2app'],
	)
	
	Note: be sure to add any data files needed by internbot to the DATA_FILES array
	
4. Clean the build and distribution folders (Do this before every new build):
	rm -rf build dist
	
5. Build the executable with:
	python setup.py py2app --packages=wx --iconfile y2.icns
	
	
6. She be in the dist/
